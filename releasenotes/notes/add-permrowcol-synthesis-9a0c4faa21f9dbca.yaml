    This release introduces a new transpiler synthesis pass using a PermRowCol
    algorithm for routing CNOTS as efficiently as possible. Instead of
    SWAP-based techniques, the synthesis pass uses a few Steiner Tree-based
    PermRowCol transpilation algorithm.

    The PermRowCol algorithm dynamically reallocates logical qubits during the
    computation, and thus results in fewer output CNOTs than the algorithms
    Steiner-Gauss and RowCol. Each SWAP-gate adds three CNOT-gates, which
    causes significant overhead. PermRowCol utilises bridge template which acts
    like a remote CNOT instead of SWAP-gates, which reduces the required number
    of added CNOT-gates. However, the bridge template does not move the qubits.

    Added a new transpiler synthesis pass PermRowColSynthesis that uses a
    PermRowCol algorithm for routing CNOTS as efficiently as possible. Instead
    of SWAP-based techniques, the synthesis pass uses a few Steiner Tree-based
    PermRowCol transpilation algorithm.

    The PermRowCol algorithm dynamically reallocates logical qubits during the
    computation, and thus results in fewer output CNOTs than the algorithms
    Steiner-Gauss and RowCol. Each SWAP-gate adds three CNOT-gates, which
    causes significant overhead. PermRowCol utilises bridge template which acts
    like a remote CNOT instead of SWAP-gates, which reduces the required number
    of added CNOT-gates. However, the bridge template does not move the qubits.

    Added a :class:`PermRowColSynthesis` that inherits
    :class:`LinearFunctionsSynthesis`, and upon initialization receives a
    :class:`CouplingMap` object denoting the applicable connections between
    qubits.

    In :func:`PermRowColSynthesis.run()` method the function receives
    :class:`DAGCircuit` object to re-synthesize, and the method returns a
    :class:`DAGCircuit` object. The synthesis pass utilizes :class:`PermRowCol`
    that gets a :class:`CouplingMap` object upon initialization.

    Added a :class:`PermRowCol` that receives a :class:`CouplingMap` upon
    initialization. The class executes the PermRowCol algorithm.

    The circuit is rerouted by every node by running
    :func:`PermRowCol.perm_row_col()` that receives as input a parity matrix
    that is the linear representation of a given node. The function modifies
    the parity matrix and returns two :class:`QuantumCircuit` objects that
    corresponds with the re-synthesized circuit and the qubit allocation. The
    input parity matrix will also correspond to the qubit allocation after
    the function is run.

    :func:`PermRowCol.run()` will change the two :class:`QuantumCircuit` objects
    into two :class:`DAGCircuit` objects and try to compose them together???? If this is not possible, just one  :class:`DAGCircuit` object made from the circuit is used.

    After the circuit has been re-synthesized in this manner by every node, it is returned a output.
